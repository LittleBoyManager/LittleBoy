#### 1. Why are our software being killed by anti-virus software?
We need to simulate a mouse and keyboard. Such a simulation may be considered a virus by anti-virus software. You can log in to EVE and run our software. Your account is secure. It can also be done using a virtual machine. 


#### 2. Why does the EVE client shut down when I start the BOT?
You need to run the registration program correctly, RegCOM.exe. Ensure that the software is not killed by anti-virus software. 


#### 3. What is our payment model?
We are licensing different levels of EVE's role. A role can be used to license the corresponding level of service. 


#### 4. Can I purchase an advanced license when I purchase a low-level license and the time has not expired?
Yes, we will keep your low-level license time and start calculating the advanced license time. After the advanced license expires, start calculating your low-level license. 


#### 5. If I need to launch multiple EVE clients at the same time, what do I need to do?
You need to be under an account. Add multiple roles, each of which is a separate license. 


#### 6. Is $14.99 too expensive for SuperCarrier?
We can calculate, for example, SuperCarrier Ratting, using SuperCarrier, the income per hour is about 150m, 10 hours a day, ISK income is about 1.5B, and IB can get 3B ISK in two days, corresponding to about 750 PLEX. You can buy 500 PLEX for $14.99. At the same time, we are still carrying out promotional activities, and the fee can be 30% off. 


#### 7. How the promotion is carried out?
Recruit your friend and get reward.Share your invitation code to your friends. As your friends use your code when they register, they will become your recruits. As your recruits add time to their toons, 30% of the amount of their balance comsumed will be added to your account in 30 days. 


#### 8. Why can't I still jump to the Site?
Please read the tutorial in detail. You need to separate the Anomaliy panel from the Scanners panel. 


#### 9. Why didn't I find a safe spot?
Please make sure that the security point name you set is the same as the security point name in the game (note the space), and the area in the upper left corner should not be blocked. 


#### 10. Why do I lock Fortizar?
Please be sure to load an overview of our BOT. There is a detailed introduction in the video tutorial.
